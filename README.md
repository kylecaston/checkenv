# checkenv

A modern best-practice is to [store your application's configuration in environmental variables](http://12factor.net/config).  This allows you to keep all config data outside of your repository, and store it in a standard, system-agnostic location.  Modern build/deploy/development tools make it easier to manage these variables per-host, but they're still often undocumented, and can lead to bugs when missing.

This module lets you define all the environmental variables your application relies on in an `env.json` file.  It then provides a method to check for these variables at application launch, and print a help screen if any are missing.

Inspired from the popular npm package, [checkenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/checkenv).
